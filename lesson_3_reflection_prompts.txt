When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Share your code
    Collaborate with other team members
    Keep a safe copy of the code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes may be made one place or the other which require merging.
	You may be doing an experiment that can't accept the remote changes, yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks - happens only on github.  makes a clone of the repository on your
	        own account.  you would use this when you want to try changes
			to a repository for which you do not have permission to make 
			changes.  
	clones - make a complete copy of a current repository - either Github to 
             local or local to local.  This allow independent work to 
			 take place without affecting the copy you cloned from.  These
			 changes can then be pushed back to the original.
    branches - this allows a separate line of development to take place but
               still under the same repository.  Changes made in branches 
               will be committed to their own branch and can be merged into
               the production or main branch (master) when they are ready			   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Keeps things straight if you are working offline.
