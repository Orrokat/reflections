What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Sets up special files to track the repository.  It does not commit 
	any files at this point.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	It seems to be the in between place for moving files into the repoisitory.
	It makes sense to me - it lets you isolate the files that belong in a 
	particular logical piece so that they can be commited together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
     You can change the files you need to, then stage them in logical groups.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
    experimentation - you can make changes and commit them, keeping history so 
	you don't lose work. But the master can remain untouched or continue with routine
    maintenance.  the branch can then be merged in when and if it is deemed
    appropriate.

    on a larger project multiple people may be working on the sam set of files.
    branching allows each person to work in isolation until their unit testing
	is complete, then merge when appropriate.	

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    It shows the clear pathway of reachability as well as highlighting how
	some branches are not reachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
